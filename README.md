# Finding the Best Markets to Advertise in an E-learning Product
This repository contains a notebook where I find the best markets to advertise an e-learning product that offers courses on programming. 

I use [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969). [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development.

The survey data is publicly available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey). 

The notebook is based on a guided project from Dataquest, an online Data Science bootcamp. The project's learning goal was to test understanding of distributions, averages and variance.
